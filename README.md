This is a gif generator. A user may select the pre-made buttons available on the page or create their own buttons through the customer search bar. By using the search bar and clicking the submit button, the user will create their own topic button. When selecting this new button the topic the user inputed will generate new gifs. To play the gif, it must be clicked on.
